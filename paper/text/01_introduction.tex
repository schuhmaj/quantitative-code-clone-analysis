\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

What does \textit{quality} mean? The Oxford Dictionary defines it as "the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind".\footnote{\url{https://www.lexico.com/definition/quality} last accessed: 05.07.2022}, which only leads to more questions about the meaning of standard, measurement, similar kind. A pretty difficult definition, although the word is can be found nearly everywhere.
If one zooms in, one can try to partially define the word, e.g. in the context of software engineering. According to the ISO 9000 - Quality management, "(Software) Quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements, meaning needs or expectations that are stated, generally implied or obligatory" \cite{matthes2020ase}.
Even this restricted definition is still a bit fuzzy. By further zooming in one can separate between internal and external quality. Here, the former describes the properties of the code in context of a software system \cite{pretschner2022requirements}.
One of such properties could be the density of code clones, also refereed to as clone coverage. Clone coverage describes the number of statements being part of clone, i.e. duplicate \cite{knilling2020priorisierung}.
