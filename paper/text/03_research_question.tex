\section{Research Question}
\label{sec:research_question}

After introducing the topic, the following research questions may arise which are covered in this work:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which programming languages suffer mostly from high clone coverage?
	\item Do modern programming languages have lower clone coverage compared to older languages?
	\item Can we infer that a simpler, less verbose programming language always leads to less code clones?
\end{enumerate}

Important to note is that a question analyzing the "Why?" is missing since the following case study relies on quantitatively measuring code clone coverage in thousands of projects by just examining the source code, but not concrete software engineering process, i.e. principles of those projects. Rather \autoref{sec:results} will show certain trends for specific programming languages which are then discussed based on the formulated research questions in \autoref{sec:discussion}.
